    "description": "This report presents the complete experimental validation of the Simplified Theory of Everything (STOE), version V12. It includes theoretical predictions and visual comparisons with real data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), cosmological redshift observations, and high-energy collisions at the LHC. The model demonstrates a high degree of match with empirical data across three domains. This unified publication aims to support interdisciplinary discussions in cosmology, particle physics, and quantum field theory.",
